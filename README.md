## AI SCIKIT-LEARN BASIC STEPS

This repo contains a Jupyter notebook with the essential spots you need to train an AI model using the scikit-learn library.

Install the requirements.txt to have access the the needed dependencies.

After reading the CSV (also inside this repo) the script takes the "quality" field, which will be the one predicted, out of the dataset, dividing it into training and testing.

Afterwards, we train different models contained inside the library to test how well they work with this data.

Finally, que pass a new row of data to the RFC model, and outpu its result, testing that it works properly in a small scale.
